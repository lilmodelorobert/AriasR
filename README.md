Weather Sprint
Brief description:
Peer reviewed by: Jerrod Packard
Peer review comments: The search functionality works really well. Every city I entered returned data for current weather and the 5 day forecast. In terms of the Figma, your design isn't quite there. There are some issues with the design, but those are some pretty easy fixes for the most part. I wish you had some geolocation functionality, and a favorites feature would be nice too, but what you have works well. If you kept working on this you would have a nice piece to show off.
